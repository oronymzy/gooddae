# Good Dae

??? info "Synopsis"
    Nolu, an archival daemon, is separated from his user in a widespread network outage and works to restore connectivity to the system.

My entry for [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) 2018. I'll be doing my best to reach the expected goal of 50,000 words, but the real priority is the following three things:

* [ ] Include a beginning, middle, and end.
* [ ] Emphasize [positivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology).
* [ ] Promote multiple mascots for permissively-licensed software projects.

I'll be updating the Git repository during the month. Everything is licensed [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). The story is almost entirely unplanned, so I'll be happy to end up with something enjoyable. Coherence is optional.
